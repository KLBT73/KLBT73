My name is Kyle Bennett and I'm a student at Mizzou studying Information Technology. This README document is for a challenge in my INFOTC 1600 class.
For this challenge, I chose to markdown the "Competitive" page from the Rocket League Wiki found [here](https://rocketleague.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_League_Wiki).

# Competitive

**Competitive** is one of the two core online gameplay modes within _Rocket League_. The competitive mode is based purely on skill tiers which will loosely determine the skill of a player.

- [Playlists](#playlists)
  - [Standard](#standard)
  - [Doubles](#doubles)
  - [Solo Duel](#solo-duel)
  - [Solo Standard](#solo-standard)
- [Ranking](#ranking)


# Playlists
There are seven competitive playlists:

1. Solo Duel
2. Doubles
3. Standard
4. Rumble
5. Dropshot
6. Hoops
7. Snow Day

***Note:*** Each player has a separate progression for each playlist (i.e. it is possible to be silver 3 in doubles and diamond 2 in standard).

### Standard
*Standard* is generally the most popular competitive playlist. As the name indicates, it is the standard online game mode. In standard, the team is composed of three players, therefore, teamwork is crucial to victory. Because of the number of players involved in the gameplay, it is recommended that players maintain tactical positions and rotation across the arena.

### Doubles
*Doubles* is a popular competitive playlist. Doubles is very popular because standard tends to balance the game less proportionally when there are more players to play with or against. In doubles, you need to co-operate with only one teammate.

### Solo Duel
*Solo Duel* is arguably the most balanced in terms of raw skill. Because it is simply a one-on-one game, solo duel is not based at all on co-operating in a team, but on strategy and skill in the arena.

### Solo Standard
*Solo Standard* was a mode similar to Standard, and it was removed in Patch v1.81. It was generally the least popular competitive playlist. It was the same as standard in team size and game dynamics. The main feature of this game mode was that players couldn't join with their friends in a party and clubs couldn't join either. This playlist forced you to co-operate with the largest number of teammates available in ranked along with the team variation.

# Ranking
You can track your stats and current competitive progression on Rocket League Tracker, a website that allows for competitive players to track their progression as each season rolls along.

If you are on PlayStation, Xbox or Steam/Epic on PC simply enter your PSN username, Xbox Live Gamertag, Steam username or Epic username and set the selection bar to PlayStation, Xbox, Steam or Epic.

If you are playing via Steam you can also open Steam, click your avatar on the top right corner of the window and select 'View my profile'. Right-click your profile background and click "Copy Page URL". This will put your profile URL on your clipboard. Paste it into the search box.

After each season (lasting roughly 3-4 months), ranks are reset and each player must play a total of 10 placement games per game mode in order to secure a ranked placement.
